# QA-Chatbot-PDF
  This is a small project of a QA Chatbot based on the context of PDF files, without using external repositories like pinecone or llamaindex.
The application can be launched from a local mode as it has a GUI that allows to select PDF file and enter a question.
Currently the code contains a bug, the answer generated by the AI contains irrelevant information (such as author data or links provided in the pdf).
