# QA-Chatbot-PDF
 It is a small chatbot project using Langchain and openai, used to review and perform QA on PDF files locally. It allows to upload PDF files, enter api key and enter the question to ask. the biggest problem with the app is the response generated by the model, it is not completely visualized in the GUI.
It has no major add-ons. Any possible contribution is welcome.
